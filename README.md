# Sui2StatsChecker

FIRST RELEASE: 10/24/16
Quick 'n dirty program to calculate individual probabilities of getting certain stat values for characters in Suikoden II.

USE:
Should be pretty straightforward. Pick a character, level, and stat you'd like to explore. HP takes a while for higher levels, but that's just the nature of the calculations.

INTERPRETATION:
Stat is the raw value of the stat. 
Probability is simply the chance (in %) of that specific stat occurring relative to other possibilities.
Cumulative is the "remaining" probability for stats at or greater than the current one. To put it another way, the cumulative value for a stat is the probability of getting that stat or higher for the specified level.
For probability and cumulative values, I have them listed out to 4 decimal places. Since the anser is given in %, a value of 0.0001% corresponds to 1 out of a million. Likewise, 0.1% is 1 out of a thousand.
